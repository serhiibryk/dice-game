# Dice Game

A simple interactive dice game built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Material UI**.

---

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js (App Router)](https://nextjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com)
- `localStorage` (for saving game history)

---

## Features

- User sets a threshold from 0 to 100.
- Chooses "Over" or "Under" as a condition.
- Clicks "Play" to roll a random number from 1 to 100.
- If the rolled number satisfies the condition — user wins.
- Displays win/lose result via styled message.
- Saves each game into history (max 10 records).
- History is persisted in `localStorage`.

## How the Game Works

1. You select a threshold (e.g. `20`).
2. You choose the direction:
   - **Over** — number should be `> 20`
   - **Under** — number should be `< 20`
3. Press **PLAY**.
4. Dice rolls a number from 1 to 100.
5. Result is shown immediately with success/fail message.
6. The outcome is saved to the game history (up to 10 entries).
